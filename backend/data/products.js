    description:
      "Specializing in spin and power, the Babolat Pure Aero is one of the game's most legendary racquets. At 11.2 ounces strung, this stick is ideal for hard charging intermediate players, but it should also work very well for the advanced ball striker who is looking to go on offense.  For this update, Babolat lowers the flex a tad, giving this notoriously stiff stick a slightly more controlled and arm-friendly response. Babolat has also moved the Cortex dampening material to the head at 3 & 9 o'clock, resulting in a slightly softer feel at impact. But make no mistake: this is still a firm, modern and lively weapon. The signature technology,  called FSI Spin, utilizes wider string spacing for extra bite along with oblong grommets at 6 and 12 o'clock to maximize string movement and snapback. Like the player who endorses this racquet (Rafael Nadal), the Pure Aero feels fast and explosive from the baseline. The speedy response and grippy stringbed provide the recipe for hitting heavy spin-loaded balls that drop hard, and the higher trajectory response makes it easy to keep the ball deep. The mid 320 swingweight draws a nice compromise between speed and stability, and the quick handling makes this a great stick for those who like chasing down balls or ripping winners on the run. At net the Pure Aero plays great on fast exchanges, and there is enough power to finish points with a bang. Ultimately, The Pure Aero remains a very obvious choice for aggressive baseliners looking to control the action with pace and spin.",

    description:
      "For 2019 Babolat makes some incremental tweaks to the Pure Aero Plus while keeping the same basic formula that made this stick such an obvious choice for aggressive ball strikers. Although it shares many features with the standard Pure Aero, this racquet comes with an extra half inch of length, making it more challenging to swing but giving it noticeably more pop on groundies and serves. For this version, Babolat has updated its Cortex technology with a more advanced dampening compound along with repositioning it to a more optimal location higher in the racquet. The result is a slightly softer feel at impact.  The Pure Aero Plus also features FSI Spin technology, which utilizes wider string spacing for extra bite along with oblong grommets at 6 and 12 o'clock to maximize string movement and snapback (think spin). On groundies the Pure Aero Plus is dangerous in the hands of an aggressive baseliner. It rewards big swings with heavy, spin-loaded balls that drop hard and explode off the court. Boasting a heavier dynamic weight than the standard version, this stick also does a better job absorbing and redirecting the pace of big hitters. On serve, this racquet's extended length provides big power, with plenty of spin for adding nasty action on slices and kickers. The Pure Aero Plus also provides plenty of options on service returns where it is stable enough to block big first serves while also being precise enough on full swings to punish second serves. Ultimately, the Pure Aero Plus remains an obvious choice for big hitters looking to go on offense. ",

      "Babolat adds another chapter to the game's most iconic modern player's racquet. As with previous versions of the Pure Drive, this update keeps the same easy learning curve and explosive spec profile that has attracted generations of players. Updated with Babolat's new HTR System, the Pure Drive's graphite layup has been reengineered for higher torsional rigidity, resulting in more efficient energy transfer to the ball. To help with vibration dampening, Babolat has devoted more space in the shaft to SWX Pure Feel, a thin and extremely flexible viscoelastic rubber that sits between the racquet's carbon layers. Additional features include FSI Power Technology, which optimizes the grommet system and string spacing for higher levels of power and spin. On court, this racquet's explosive acceleration and spin-friendly targeting make it a dangerous weapon from the baseline. It also packs impressive all-court mobility, making it great for cranking winners on the run or charging into the front court and finishing points at net. With incremental tweaks to the feel, this update won't disappoint especially if you place a premium on quick handling. The Pure Drive continues to be one of the best options for those who want a light and explosive player's racquet. ",

    description:
      "With this racquet, Babolat updates the popular Pure Strike 16x19 with a new dampening technology while keeping the seductive playability of the previous generation. Boasting a slightly higher swingweight than the previous generation, this racquet packs a tad more stability and power, but it's still fast enough for aggressive all-court players, and it still offers the same mindless precision on full cuts. Like the previous generation, it has a hybrid frame construction (called Control Frame Technology), which blends the control and feel of square beam with the speed and dynamism of a modern elliptical beam. This racquet also has FSI Power technology which features wider spacing between the upper cross strings for easier access to spin and pace. New to this frame is C² Pure Feel, a material technology that combines cortex with a uniquely flexible viscoelastic rubber at 3/9 o'clock. The upshot is an even more dampened feel than the previous generation with slightly better pocketing. From the baseline the Pure Strike 16x19 feels solid and surgical. It offers the spin-friendly precision of the Pure Drive but with a softer response and better ball feedback. The higher swingweight of this 3rd Gen version comes in handy when battling against higher levels of pace or driving the ball through the court. At net the Pure Strike offers the best of both worlds. It comes around with decent speed but it also feels stable against higher levels of pace, and it's versatile enough for finishing points with a bang or dropping the ball on a dime. With some incremental updates to the feel, the Pure Strike 16x19 remains one of the more seductive and user-friendly player's racquets in Babolat's line-up.",

In addition to updating this racquet with a 16x20 string pattern, Wilson reinforces the upper hoop to create a more solid and responsive hitting surface. As with the first generation of Clash racquets, the 98 v2 is defined by Wilson's innovative frame technology, originally called FreeFlex. Renamed FORTYFIVE, this patented frame technology enables the racquet to bend (and soften impact) across a wider geometry of stoke paths. The payoff is greater comfort when addressing the ball at extreme angles, a fact that makes the Clash very appealing to topspin players in search of a more tendon friendly option.

At 10.4 ounces strung, the Ultra 100L should appeal to a broad range of intermediate players, including the occasional league player or weekend warrior.According to Wilson, this racquet's big power comes from three strategic enhancements. It starts with less racquet twisting at impact (stability), which is achieved by combining a Power Rib construction in the shaft with an integrated Perimeter Weight System in the head. These features are complemented by Sweetspot Channels at 3/9 o'clock, which lengthen the cross strings for greater energy return.This racquet also has Crush Zone grommets in the throat, which compress like a spring at impact.On groundstrokes, the Ultra 100L not only feels crisp and accurate, it's also faster than the previous generation, making it great for cranking winners on the run.With its Powerful Frame Geometry, pace comes easy, and there is more than enough spin-potential to bring the ball down hard. The user-friendly speed continues at net where this racquet will help you react quickly or spring into action when opportunity knocks. The Ultra 100L also performs great on service returns where it comes around extremely fast to deliver an effective combination of pace and accuracy.

Like the previous generation, this update features the same silky texture and elegant simplicity. It also features a small silhouette of Federer, laser engraved graphics and a reproduction of Federer's signature.  As a member of the classic Pro Staff family, this racquet features Wilson's timeless Pro Staff formula, including a braided graphite/aramid layup, headlight balance, thin beam and Perimeter Weighting System.

In addition to surgical control and mindless touch, player's who can leverage the mass will find heavy pace and plenty of put-away power. At net this stick does not get pushed around. Simple blocks result in penetrating replies, and there is enough touch and pop to hit every shot in the book. You'll also find the required power, spin and precision on serve to rack up free points.

Head updates this model with Graphene 360 a technology that not only delivers the benefits of polarized weighting but also reinforces the racquet's perimeter in key locations to provide a more solid and powerful response. Other technologies include a Dynamic String Pattern, which optimizes the spacing of the center main strings for better directional control.

On groundstrokes, the 98 square inch head feels precise on big cuts, and the 325 swingweight supplies the needed mass for driving the ball powerfully through the court.

      "Introducing the Ripstick 100 (300)! With this racquet Prince has created a powerful modern player's racquet with above average comfort for the breed. At 11.2 ounces strung, the Ripstick is not only fast enough for intermediate players, it also packs a near 330 swingweight, giving it enough stability and plow through to tempt the more advanced ball striker. This racquet's comfortable feel comes partly from the extra large O-Ports that surround the hitting area. This feature not only produces a more plush and powerful string bed, it also creates less wind-drag for easier acceleration. Additional features include Prince's Anti-Torsion System (ATS), which combines TexTreme and Twaron in the shaft and upper hoop to deliver a smoother, more stable hitting experience. On groundstrokes the Ripstick hits a powerful ball, making it easy for you to take control of the point. The open 16x18 pattern not only helps with spin-potential, it also provides a higher trajectory, resulting in easier access to depth. At net the Ripstick comes around with lightning speed, and it will give you enough power to finish points with a bang. This racquet also shines on serve where it rewards fast swings with enough pop to put the returner in check. With the introduction of the Ripstick 100 (300), Prince has delivered an impressive weapon to intermediate players in search of power. The arm-friendly comfort is a nice bonus.",

At only 10.4 ounces strung, this speedy racquet is not only suitable for intermediates, it should also work for the dedicated beginner or savvy doubles specialists who wants speed, power and spin. Compared to the Ripstick 100 300, this stick is lighter and faster, making it easier for the player to prepare the racquet and achieve effective contact with the ball. This racquet gives you the benefit of extra large O-Ports, a feature that produces a more plush and powerful string bed along with less wind-drag for easier acceleration. Additional features include Prince's Anti-Torsion System (ATS), which combines TexTreme and Twaron in the shaft and upper hoop to deliver a smoother, more stable hitting experience.

As with the heavier 300 gram version, power comes easy, and the open 16x18 string pattern is extremely spin-friendly. At net this racquet's quick handling will help you stay active. Although not quite as stable as the Ripstick 100 (300), this racquet's head heavy balance helps when redirecting higher levels of pace. This stick also shines on serve where you'll find enough power and spin to coax weak replies. Ultimately, with the Ripstick 100 (280), Prince delivers the high comfort that we've come to expect from their O-Port frames. Intermediate players looking for a speedy and spin-friendly weapon with plenty of power should give this one a serious look.",
